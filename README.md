# Feed-forward-NN
This is a step by step implementation of a Feed forward neural networks using Tensorflow. The dataset used is imbalanced, SMOTE alogirthm is used to deal with this issue. make sure to stratify the dataset.
The file 'numpy' contains an implementation of Feed forward neural nets using only numpy library (still ongoing)
